# Functional Doggies

A new fun way to view dogs.

## Umm, why?

I made this project because I wanted to practice some functional programming in plain JavaScript. It sort of turned into this weird React/Vuejs looking thing. Feel free to fork/edit/light on fire.

Thanks dog.ceo for the coo' images.

## Run

```
npm install
npm start
```
